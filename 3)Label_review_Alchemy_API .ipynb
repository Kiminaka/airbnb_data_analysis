      "    \"text\": \"If there's one Thanksgiving mistake Jack Bishop sees more than any other, it's people rushing to carve their birds. Bishop is editorial director of the public TV series America's Test Kitchen. He tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross, \\\"Turkey needs to rest before you carve it ... and a lot fewer juices will end up on the carving board.\\\"\\nBishop and Bridget Lancaster, also of America's Test Kitchen, share their tips for buying, seasoning and cooking a turkey, and describe some of their favorite side dishes.\\nOn buying, seasoning and carving your turkey\\nLancaster: Don't buy too big of a bird \\u2014 12 to 14 pounds is kind of the limit. Any larger than that and you're going to have a really big problem cooking it evenly because ... the breast meat tends to cook a lot faster than the dark meat. And it's also a problem of mechanics: It's really hard to get a 20-pound turkey into some of the more modern ovens. ...\\nAfter that, it's really making sure you season the turkey. We like natural turkeys, ones that aren't pre-brined or injected, so you either want to brine it \\u2014 soak the turkey in saltwater solution \\u2014 or you can rub salt under the skin. And that really, along with time, helps to season the turkey well. You do want to let either the brine or the salt rub do its job. Salting takes a bit more time. ... Twenty-four hours is a good period of time to wait. ... It slowly seasons it.\\nBreast meat is great when it's salted because it tends to hang on [to] its moisture a bit more, so it gives you a window or an error cushion.\\nBishop: There's a rush to carve. Turkey needs to rest before you carve it. If you're using a small bird like Bridget suggests ... it's maybe 30 minutes. If you've got a larger bird, maybe 40 minutes. And there [are] two things that you're doing: One is it's much simpler to carve a bird that's not scorching hot; the second thing is you're letting the muscle fibers relax so that they can hold onto more of those juices.\\nOn getting crispy skin on your turkey \\nLancaster: One way is we rub the skin with a mixture of salt and pepper and a little bit of baking powder. And the baking powder seems very odd, but it actually is starting to dry out the surface just a little bit, ... that and loosening the skin and getting some of the seasoning under the skin. You can finish it off at a pretty high temperature just to give it a nice final blast of heat that will give it really nice crisp skin.\\nOn not stuffing your turkey\\nBishop: Instead, put the stuffing in a dish \\u2014 but then it becomes \\\"dressing,\\\" if you want to be technical about it. The problem is, when you stuff the turkey, yes, the stuffing gets all of the wonderful flavors from the bird, but it makes it much more difficult to cook the bird. It cooks a lot more slowly and unevenly, and obviously if you've got vegetarians then they're not going to eat the stuffing. So I always do it in buttered baked dishes and cover it with foil for most of the cooking ... usually about 30 to 40 minutes until it's warm, and then take off the foil so the top can crisp up, and it's absolutely delicious. ...\\nIf you want to stuff your bird, you should actually microwave the stuffing, and then you put hot stuffing inside the turkey. It's a bit of chore, frankly, but that's the best way, if you actually are going to cook a stuffed bird, is to begin with fairly hot stuffing. You want to get it to about 120 to 130 degrees, so you don't have quite that problem with ice cold stuffing slowing down the whole process.\\nOn sweet potatoes\\nLancaster: You can't cook them like regular potatoes. They contain a lot more water ... so if you boil them in lots of liquid you end up with sweet potatoes that have fallen apart, sweet potatoes that are very soggy. They don't have that fluffy texture.\\nSo we actually braise sweet potatoes. You slice sweet potatoes very thin, about a quarter inch, and you put them in a saucepan, or you can double the recipe and put them in a Dutch oven. And just a few tablespoons of heavy cream, a couple pats of butter, and you cook it over low for a good 35 minutes or so until the potatoes are very, very tender. ... You simply mash them [and] season them with a little salt and pepper.\\nOn mashed potatoes\\nBishop: A recipe I really like to make has some bold Spanish flavors in it. So it's the traditional mashed potatoes and, in the test kitchen, we think you should boil whole russet potatoes still with the skins on. And the reason that you're doing that is you don't want them to soak up more water than is necessary, because you want them later on to soak up a lot of delicious half-and-half. ... Cook 30 to 40 minutes, ... drain them, let them cool a little bit, and then you need to peel them. ...\\nRather than just adding plain old butter and half-and-half, I like to add some smoked paprika and some toasted garlic that I've already cooked in the butter first; and stir those into the potatoes, then add a little more warm half-and-half. A lot of people add cold cream at the end, and then you end up with cold mashed potatoes. Warm that half-and-half, a little salt and pepper.\\nA great trick if you're the kind of person that doesn't want to be doing this right before dinner, is to then put it in the slow cooker on low, and you can let the mashed potatoes hang out for an hour or two in the slow cooker while you get everything else ready for dinner.\\n(Serves 4)\\nRusset potatoes make fluffier mashed potatoes, but Yukon golds have an appealing buttery flavor and can be used.\\n2 pounds russet potatoes, unpeeled\\n 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\\n 1 cup warm half-and-half\\n 1 1/2 teaspoons salt\\n Pepper\\n1. Place potatoes in large saucepan and cover with 1 inch cold water. Bring to boil over high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until potatoes are just tender (paring knife can be slipped in and out of potatoes with little resistance), 20 to 30 minutes. Drain.\\n2. Set ricer or food mill over now-empty saucepan. Using potholder or folded dish towel (to hold potatoes) and paring knife, peel skins from potatoes. Working in batches, cut peeled potatoes into large chunks and press or mill into saucepan.\\n3. Stir in butter until incorporated. Gently whisk in half-and-half, add salt, and season with pepper to taste. Serve.\\nThe extra steps in this variation are worth the trouble.\\nWhile potatoes are simmering, toast 1 teaspoon smoked paprika in 8-inch skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer to small bowl; set aside. Melt 8 tablespoons butter in small saucepan over medium-low heat. Add 3 minced garlic cloves, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring frequently, until garlic begins to brown, 12 to 14 minutes. Remove saucepan from heat immediately and set aside for 5 minutes (garlic will continue to brown). Pour butter-garlic mixture through fine-mesh strainer; reserve butter and set toasted garlic aside. Rice or mill potatoes as directed, then stir butter into potatoes until just incorporated. Season potatoes with toasted paprika, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add warm half-and-half and stir until just combined. Serve immediately, sprinkling with reserved toasted garlic.\\nCourtesy of America's Test Kitchen\\n(Makes 16 bars)\\nWhy this recipe works: Pecan bars often suffer the same problems as their pie counterpart. To avoid an overly sweet filling, we added a hefty amount of vanilla as well as a hit of bourbon (rum works, too) and plenty of salt. For a shortbread-like crust, the food processor not only made the mixing easy but also ensured we didn't overheat the butter. Adding nuts to the crust gave it appealing texture that was a good contrast to the filling. Partially baking the crust before adding the filling (as well as the requisite pecans) and returning the pan to the oven gave us a crust with the best texture and a deeper flavor.\\nYou can substitute dark rum for the bourbon if desired.\\nCrust:\\n1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour\\n 1/3 cup packed (2 1/3 ounces) light brown sugar\\n 1/4 cup pecans, toasted and chopped coarse\\n 1 teaspoon salt\\n 1/4 teaspoon baking powder\\n 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2\\u2011inch pieces and chilled\\nFilling:\\n1/2 cup packed (3 1/2 ounces) light brown sugar\\n 1/3 cup light corn syrup\\n 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled\\n 1 tablespoon bourbon\\n 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\\n 1/2 teaspoon salt\\n 1 large egg\\n 1 3/4 cups pecans, chopped coarse\\n1. For the crust: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling by folding two long sheets of aluminum foil so that they are as wide as 8\\u2011inch square baking pan. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to one another, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil and set aside.\\n2. Process flour, sugar, pecans, salt, and baking powder together in food processor until combined, about five pulses. Sprinkle butter over top and pulse until mixture is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal, about eight pulses.\\n3. Sprinkle mixture into prepared pan and press into even layer with bottom of measuring cup. Bake crust until fragrant and beginning to brown, 20 to 24 minutes.\\n4. For the filling: Meanwhile, whisk sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, bourbon, vanilla, and salt together in large bowl until sugar dissolves. Whisk in egg until combined.\\n5. Spread filling evenly over crust and sprinkle with pecans. Bake bars until top is brown and cracks start to form across surface, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.\\n6. Set pan on wire rack and let bars cool completely, about two hours. Remove bars from pan using foil, cut into squares, and serve.\\nCourtesy of America's Test Kitchen\\n\"\n",

Adding nuts to the crust gave it appealing texture that was a good contrast to the filling. Partially baking the crust before adding the filling (as well as the requisite pecans) and returning the pan to the oven gave us a crust with the best texture and a deeper flavor.\n",
      "You can substitute dark rum for the bourbon if desired.\n",
      "Crust:\n",
      "1 cup (5 ounces) all-purpose flour\n",
      " 1/3 cup packed (2 1/3 ounces) light brown sugar\n",
      " 1/4 cup pecans, toasted and chopped coarse\n",
      " 1 teaspoon salt\n",
      " 1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n",
      " 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/2‑inch pieces and chilled\n",
      "Filling:\n",
      "1/2 cup packed (3 1/2 ounces) light brown sugar\n",
      " 1/3 cup light corn syrup\n",
      " 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled\n",
      " 1 tablespoon bourbon\n",
      " 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n",
      " 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
      " 1 large egg\n",
      " 1 3/4 cups pecans, chopped coarse\n",
      "1. For the crust: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Make foil sling by folding two long sheets of aluminum foil so that they are as wide as 8‑inch square baking pan. Lay sheets of foil in pan perpendicular to one another, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan. Grease foil and set aside.\n",
      "2. Process flour, sugar, pecans, salt, and baking powder together in food processor until combined, about five pulses. Sprinkle butter over top and pulse until mixture is pale yellow and resembles coarse cornmeal, about eight pulses.\n",
      "3. Sprinkle mixture into prepared pan and press into even layer with bottom of measuring cup. Bake crust until fragrant and beginning to brown, 20 to 24 minutes.\n",
      "4. For the filling: Meanwhile, whisk sugar, corn syrup, melted butter, bourbon, vanilla, and salt together in large bowl until sugar dissolves. Whisk in egg until combined.\n",
      "5. Spread filling evenly over crust and sprinkle with pecans. Bake bars until top is brown and cracks start to form across surface, 25 to 30 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking.\n",
      "6. Set pan on wire rack and let bars cool completely, about two hours. Remove bars from pan using foil, cut into squares, and serve.\n",

In the meantime, a man from upstairs let us in; we thought he was renting the suite upstairs as he didn't introduce himself as the owner.  \\r\\nWhen we walked in, the place wasn't clean.  The man was still in the foyer, so I went out and asked him if he was Igor and he said, he was.  I told him the place was dirty and I didn't think it had been cleaned.  He walked in with me to check, agreed and asked me to call Pillow to have someone come out and clean again.  I called Pillow a while later and they apologized for the situation and said they would send someone that evening.  When we returned later that evening, the food had been removed from the drain in the kitchen sink and two cushions had been placed on the bed but nothing else was done.\\r\\nWe ended up staying here, as there were no hotels rooms available for less than $400 a night.\\r\\nI saw Igor 2 days later and I told him no one came to clean, he said he would call.

Remembering that we stayed in an expensive city, we were a bit apprehensive about this house and whether it would live up to our expectations. We knew that the Mission area was re gentrifying, yet we were still keen to give it a go. The house wasn't ready when we arrived and it smelled a bit of cigarette smoke. There was a dirty pillow case left in one of the bedrooms and trash left under the bed. We didn't even use the front bedroom as a result of this. I think the place could have been cleaned a bit better and aired out between guests. The cleaner was there when we arrived well after 3.00pm check-in and she told us that there were towels left drying in the dryer. I didn't mind that but again perhaps more time is necessary to get the place ready between guests. I also did not like the fact that someone entered the house while we were staying there (came in while we were out to dinner)! Be prepared to walk as the house is several blocks from the BART. \\n\\nThe positives: The Mission is multicultural, I practiced my Spanish, great restaurants (bring your walking shoes) and there was parking.

Instead I found a relatively ok-ish room, a very dirty bathroom that was shared between me, my husband, the host, two or three other room mates and two girls from couchsurfing (who were sleeping in the kitchen). The host should disclose that you share the bathroom with more than two people. Also the host should keep the bathroom clean. What I found was dirtier than a hostel. The whole house had a strange smell and the floor had something like crumbs that were sticking to my socks (the host asked me to take off my shoes). I had dark color socks and I could see a lot of dirt bits transferred from the floor. There was a sliding door between the room and the hosts bedroom that wasn't closing completely. There was a sliver of space where if you peek through, you could see what happens in the other room. I was there for work and my husband tagged along because we were celebrating our 2 year anniversary that week. I did not feel comfortable celebrating my anniversary knowing that someone on the other side of the sliding door could peek in. Before I booked I asked the host if it's easy to find parking in the area. He said it's easy to find parking, but he failed to say that you need a parking permit if you want to park for more than 2 hours. He mentioned a lot nearby and he said it's $10 for 12 hours, but he failed to say that you need to download an app on your phone and pay the fee with that app. Only when I arrived and after I texted him repeatedly (I flat out told him that if I have no place to park the car, I can't stay there), he told me about the app. My husband was the one looking for parking while I was at work and he is not technically inclined, plus his phone data is not fast enough to download an app without wifi connection. On top of that he gave me the incomplete name of the app and of course we downloaded the wrong thing. This is the result of the host's lack of interest at communicating with his guests and his downplaying the real situation with parking. Last but not the least, I told him that the place is subpar and I can't wait after 7 people to get into the bathroom, especially since I was there for work. He said that only one person worked in that household and technically I will not have to wait. I told him that I will bite the bullet and I'll stay for one night only. Unfortunately he didn't want to refund me for the rest of the stay, instead he forced my hand at paying two nights. At this point...\"],\n",
